# C-and-Vulkan-experiments-and-learning


What is Vulkan?
Think of Vulkan like a very detailed instruction manual for talking to your graphics card (GPU).

Your graphics card can draw millions of triangles per second
But it only speaks a very specific, technical language
Vulkan is that language - extremely powerful but also extremely complex


Analogy: Imagine cooking:

Simple way: "Make me dinner" (like older graphics APIs)
Vulkan way: "Turn stove to exactly 375°F, place pan at coordinates (2,3), add oil at 0.5ml/second for exactly 3.2 seconds..."

Vulkan gives you total control, but that means you must specify everything explicitly.



YES, exactly! You've got the basic concept right.
The Simple Version:

You write code in C or C++ (these are programming languages)
You use Vulkan API functions (like vkCreateInstance, vkDrawTriangles, etc.)
Vulkan translates your commands and sends them to your GPU
Your GPU draws graphics (triangles, colors, 3D objects, etc.)

Think of it like this:
Your C/C++ Code → Vulkan API → GPU → Graphics on Screen
Example:

You write: vkCmdDraw(commandBuffer, 3, 1, 0, 0); (C code using Vulkan)
Vulkan tells GPU: "Draw 3 vertices as a triangle"
GPU draws: A triangle appears on your screen

The Layers:

C/C++ = The language you write in
Vulkan = The "translator" that talks to graphics cards
GPU = The hardware that actually draws pixels
Screen = Where you see the result

Why both C/C++ and Vulkan?

C/C++ handles general programming (loops, variables, file reading)
Vulkan handles graphics-specific stuff (drawing triangles, managing memory on GPU, shaders)

Your triangle code is C language + Vulkan API calls working together.
So you're right - you need to learn:

C programming (the language)
Vulkan API (the graphics commands)
Graphics concepts (what triangles, pixels, 3D space mean)
